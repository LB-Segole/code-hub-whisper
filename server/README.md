## Local Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file based on `env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   
   Fill in your API keys:
   ```env
   PORT=3001
   DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key_here

   ```

3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   For development with auto-restart:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Test the connection:**
   - Health check: `http://localhost:3001/health`
   - WebSocket: `ws://localhost:3001`

## Testing

1. **Use the test page:**
   - Open `test-railway.html` in your browser
   - Enter your Railway WebSocket URL
   - Test the connection and messaging

2. **Health check:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-railway-app.railway.app/health
   ```

3. **WebSocket test with wscat:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g wscat
   wscat -c wss://your-railway-app.railway.app
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection fails with code 1006:**
   - Check if your Railway URL is correct
   - Verify environment variables are set
   - Check Railway logs for errors

2. **Audio not working:**
   - Ensure Deepgram API key is valid
   - Check browser microphone permissions
   - Verify audio format (should be base64 encoded)

3. **AI responses not working:**
   - Verify OpenAI API key is valid
   - Check OpenAI API quota/limits
   - Review server logs for API errors

### Logs

View Railway logs:
```bash
railway logs
```

Or check the Railway dashboard for real-time logs.

## Client Integration

Update your React app to use the Railway WebSocket URL:

```javascript
// In your environment variables
REACT_APP_RAILWAY_WS_URL=wss://your-railway-app.railway.app

// In your WebSocket hook
const RAILWAY_WS_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_RAILWAY_WS_URL;
```

## Security Notes

- Keep your API keys secure
- Use HTTPS/WSS in production
- Consider rate limiting for production use
- Monitor API usage and costs

## Support

# Call System Fixes - Comprehensive Solution

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve the critical issues with the voice call system, including call connection problems, agent deletion failures, and real-time audio streaming issues.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Call Connection & Ringing Problem**
**Issue**: Calls were initiating successfully through SignalWire (getting call SID) but not actually ringing on the destination phone. The LaML was basic and didn't establish proper real-time conversation flow.

**Root Cause**: 
- Basic LaML configuration without real-time audio streaming
- Missing proper audio bridge between SignalWire and AI conversation system
- No WebSocket integration for bidirectional audio

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Enhanced LaML Configuration** (`supabase/functions/make-outbound-call/index.ts`):
  - Added real-time audio streaming with `<Connect><Stream>` elements
  - Integrated WebSocket connection for bidirectional conversation
  - Improved call flow with proper greeting and fallback handling
  - Added machine detection and better timeout handling

```xml
<!-- Enhanced LaML with real-time audio streaming -->
<Response>
  <Say voice="alice">${escapedGreeting}</Say>
  <Pause length="1"/>
  <Connect>
    <Stream url="${voiceWebSocketUrl}" name="voice_stream">
      <Parameter name="callId" value="${callId}"/>
      <Parameter name="assistantId" value="${assistantId}"/>
      <Parameter name="userId" value="${user.id}"/>
    </Stream>
  </Connect>
  <Say voice="alice">I'm having trouble connecting. Please try calling back.</Say>
  <Hangup/>
</Response>
```

### 2. **Agent Deletion Foreign Key Constraint**
**Issue**: Foreign key constraint error when deleting agents referenced in calls table: `Key (id)=(c5796453-2c1e-424f-80ed-d48cf0c638e7) is still referenced from table "calls"`.

**Root Cause**: 
- Foreign key constraint without CASCADE DELETE or SET NULL
- No proper handling of associated call records

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Database Migration** (`supabase/migrations/20250620000000_fix_foreign_key_constraints.sql`):
  - Modified foreign key constraints to use `ON DELETE SET NULL`
  - Added safe deletion function with active call checking
  - Preserved call history while allowing agent deletion

```sql
-- Fixed foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE public.calls 
ADD CONSTRAINT calls_assistant_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (assistant_id) 
REFERENCES public.assistants(id) 
ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

- **Enhanced Agent Management** (`supabase/functions/agents/index.ts`):
  - Added active call detection before deletion
  - Implemented proper cleanup of associated calls
  - Added detailed error responses and logging

### 3. **End Call Function Configuration**
**Issue**: End-call function failing with "SignalWire credentials not configured" errors.

**Root Cause**: 
- Incorrect environment variable names
- Wrong API endpoint construction
- Missing proper call record lookup

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Fixed Environment Variables** (`supabase/functions/end-call/index.ts`):
  - Corrected variable names: `SIGNALWIRE_TOKEN` instead of `SIGNALWIRE_API_TOKEN`
  - Added proper space URL handling
  - Implemented call record lookup to find SignalWire call SID

```typescript
// Fixed environment variable handling
const signalwireProjectId = Deno.env.get('SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT_ID')
const signalwireToken = Deno.env.get('SIGNALWIRE_TOKEN')
const signalwireSpace = Deno.env.get('SIGNALWIRE_SPACE_URL')
```

### 4. **Call Duration Issues**
**Issue**: Calls terminating quickly (under 15 seconds) due to improper audio stream handling.

**Root Cause**: 
- No real-time audio streaming implementation
- Missing proper conversation flow
- Inadequate call timeout handling

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Real-time Audio Streaming** (`supabase/functions/voice-websocket/index.ts`):
  - Created dedicated WebSocket endpoint for audio streaming
  - Integrated Deepgram for real-time STT/TTS
  - Implemented proper conversation flow management

- **Improved Call Parameters**:
  - Added machine detection for better call handling
  - Optimized timeout values (30 seconds for answer)
  - Enhanced call status tracking

### 5. **Real-time Audio Flow Architecture**
**Issue**: Missing proper integration between SignalWire's call control and Deepgram's real-time STT/TTS.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **WebSocket-based Audio Pipeline**:
  - SignalWire → WebSocket Stream → Deepgram STT → AI Processing → Deepgram TTS → SignalWire
  - Bidirectional real-time audio streaming
  - Proper error handling and reconnection logic

## Technical Implementation Details

### Call Flow Architecture
```
1. User initiates call → make-outbound-call function
2. SignalWire receives LaML with WebSocket stream configuration
3. Call connects to voice-websocket function
4. Real-time audio streaming begins:
   - Incoming audio → Deepgram STT → AI processing
   - AI response → Deepgram TTS → Outgoing audio
5. Call status updates tracked in database
6. Call completion handled by end-call function
```

### Database Schema Improvements
- Fixed foreign key constraints for proper agent deletion
- Added indexes for better performance
- Implemented safe deletion functions
- Enhanced call status tracking

### Error Handling and Logging
- Comprehensive error logging throughout the system
- Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Graceful degradation for failed connections

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# SignalWire Configuration
SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
SIGNALWIRE_TOKEN=your_api_token
SIGNALWIRE_SPACE_URL=your_space_url
SIGNALWIRE_PHONE_NUMBER=your_phone_number

# AI Services
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key
```

## Testing and Validation

### Call Connection Test
1. Initiate a call through the make-outbound-call function
2. Verify SignalWire call SID is received
3. Check that destination phone rings
4. Confirm WebSocket connection is established
5. Test real-time conversation flow

### Agent Deletion Test
1. Create an agent with associated calls
2. Attempt to delete agent with active calls (should fail gracefully)
3. Complete or cancel active calls
4. Delete agent (should succeed and preserve call history)

### End Call Test
1. Initiate a call
2. Use end-call function to terminate
3. Verify SignalWire call is properly ended
4. Confirm database status is updated

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Key Log Points
- Call initiation and SignalWire API responses
- WebSocket connection establishment
- Audio streaming status
- AI processing and response generation
- Call completion and cleanup

### Performance Metrics
- Call connection success rate
- Audio streaming latency
- AI response generation time
- Call duration statistics

## Next Steps and Recommendations

1. **Deploy the database migration** to fix foreign key constraints
2. **Update environment variables** with correct SignalWire configuration
3. **Test the complete call flow** with real phone numbers
4. **Monitor call quality** and adjust audio parameters as needed
5. **Implement additional error handling** for edge cases
6. **Add call analytics** for better insights into call performance

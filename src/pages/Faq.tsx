      question: 'How does AI Voice Caller work?',
      answer: 'AI Voice Caller combines three key technologies: TTS (Text-to-Speech) to generate human-like voice from text, STT (Speech-to-Text) to convert spoken words into text, and LLM (Large Language Models) to power natural conversations. When a call is initiated, our system establishes a connection via SignalWire, enabling the AI to speak, listen, understand, and respond in real-time.',
      category: 'general',
    },
    {
      id: '2',
      question: 'What types of calls can the AI handle?',
      answer: 'Our AI Voice Caller can handle a variety of call types including sales outreach, appointment reminders, customer follow-ups, surveys and feedback collection, lead qualification, and routine notifications. The system can be trained for your specific use case to ensure optimal performance.',
      category: 'general',
    },
    {
      id: '3',
      question: 'How natural does the AI voice sound?',
      answer: 'Our AI voices are designed to sound highly natural. We use advanced TTS technology from providers like Deepgram and ElevenLabs to create voices with natural intonation, pacing, and emotion. Many users report that the AI voices are indistinguishable from human voices in most conversations.',
      category: 'technology',
    },
    {
      id: '4',
      question: 'What languages are supported?',
      answer: 'Currently, our system supports English (US, UK, Australian, Indian), Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese. We\'re constantly adding support for more languages and regional accents.',
      category: 'technology',
    },
    {
      id: '5',
      question: 'How much does it cost?',
      answer: 'Our pricing is based on call volume with plans starting at $49/month for up to 500 minutes. We offer a free tier for up to 50 minutes per month so you can test the system. Custom enterprise plans are available for high-volume users. Please visit our pricing page for detailed information.',

      category: 'features',
    },
    {
      id: '7',
      question: 'How does the AI handle complex conversations?',
      answer: 'Our AI is powered by advanced large language models that can understand context, remember previous parts of the conversation, and handle unexpected responses. While it excels in structured conversations, it can also adapt to many unscripted scenarios. The AI continuously improves through training and feedback.',
      category: 'technology',
    },
    {
      id: '8',
      question: 'Are calls recorded and transcribed?',

    },
    {
      id: '9',
      question: 'Is the service compliant with privacy regulations?',
      answer: 'Yes, we designed our platform with privacy in mind. We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant privacy regulations. We recommend informing call recipients that they are speaking with an AI system to meet disclosure requirements in your jurisdiction.',
